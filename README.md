- Detect all the objects
- Count just the targeted objects
- Count all the objects
- Predict color of the targeted objects
- Predict color of all the objects
- Predict speed of the targeted objects
- Predict speed of all the objects
- Print out the detection-counting result in a .csv file as an analysis report
- Save and store detected objects as new images under [detected_object folder](www)
- Select, download and use state of the art [models that are trained by Google Brain Team](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md)
- Use [your own trained models](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras) or [a fine-tuned model](https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials/blob/master/10_Fine-Tuning.ipynb) to detect spesific object/s
- Save detection and counting results as a new video or show detection and counting results in real time
- Process images or videos depending on your requirements

Here are some cool architectural design features of TensorFlow Object Counting API:

- Lightweigth, runs in real-time
- Scalable and well-designed framework, easy usage
- Gets "Pythonic Approach" advantages
- It supports REST Architecture and RESTful Web Services

TODOs:

- Kalman Filter based object tracker util will be developed.
- Autonomus Training Image Annotation Tool will be developed.

## Theory

### System Architecture

</p>

- Object detection and classification have been developed on top of TensorFlow Object Detection API, [see](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection) for more info.

- Object color prediction has been developed using OpenCV via K-Nearest Neighbors Machine Learning Classification Algorithm is Trained Color Histogram Features, [see](https://github.com/ahmetozlu/tensorflow_object_counting_api/tree/master/utils/color_recognition_module) for more info.

[TensorFlow™](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them.

[OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)](https://opencv.org/about.html) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products.

### Tracker

</p>

Source video is read frame by frame with OpenCV. Each frames is processed by ["SSD with Mobilenet" model](http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco_2017_11_17) is developed on TensorFlow. This is a loop that continue working till reaching end of the video. The main pipeline of the tracker is given at the above Figure.

### Models

<p align="center">

</p>

By default I use an ["SSD with Mobilenet" model](http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco_2017_11_17) in this project. You can find more information about SSD in [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-ssd-multibox-real-time-object-detection-in-deep-learning-495ef744fab). 

Please, See the [detection model zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md) for a list of other models that can be run out-of-the-box with varying speeds and accuracies. You can easily select, download and use state-of-the-art models that are suitable for your requeirements using TensorFlow Object Detection API.

You can perform transfer learning on trained TensorFlow models to build your custom object counting systems!
